# Buried Treasure

Buried Treasure is a dynamic list of Etsy items, sorted by their value to a pirate.

## What does that mean?

Pirates like things that:

* are rare,
* few have seen,
* and many people treasure.

In Etsy terms, that means a higher score is given to items that:

* have low quantity,
* have low views,
* and are in many users' treasury lists.

*The first version of this project was built for the Battle of the Braces hackathon
on August 18th, 2012.*
